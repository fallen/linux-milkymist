	  This option enables special console drivers which allow the kernel
	  to print messages very early in the bootup process.

	  This is useful for kernel debugging when your machine crashes very
	  early before the console code is initialized. You should normally
	        say N here, unless you want to debug.

	help
	  This option disables the exception handling within the kernel. It is
	  required to allow access with the JTAG debugger for kernel-level
	  debug access.

	  Your should normally say N here, unless you want to debug.
